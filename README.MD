# Advanced Features

## Exporting Wallets

- Go to File > Export Wallet

- Enter a password to encrypt the wallet file

## Importing Wallets

- Go to File > Import Wallet

- Enter the password used for encryption

# Security Considerations

- This application is primarily for educational and testing purposes.
- Never use wallets generated by this tool for storing significant amounts of real funds unless you fully understand the
  security implications.
- Private keys are displayed in the application and included in QR codes. Treat this information with utmost care.
- Exported wallet files are encrypted, but the security depends on the strength of your chosen password.
- The application automatically deletes existing wallets with the same name to prevent conflicts, so be cautious when
  naming wallets.
